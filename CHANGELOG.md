## [0.4.0-simply] - 2025-10-16 (Simply Branch)

### Added - Simplified CMS System (Day 1 Complete)

**Branch Strategy**:
- Created `simply` branch for MVP CMS implementation
- Main branch preserved with clean pre-CMS state
- Full project backup at `../ecommerce_backup/`

**Database Models** (928 lines of production code):
- **PageSection Model**: Dynamic page content management
  - Support for 3 section types: hero, content_block, product_grid
  - Pydantic validation schemas for type-safe content
  - Order field for positioning, is_active for show/hide
  - Content validation: `validate_content()` method

- **Asset Model**: File upload and management
  - Image uploads with UUID filenames (prevents overwrites)
  - Auto-dated storage structure: `uploads/YYYY/MM/`
  - 10MB size limit, images only (MVP)
  - File type detection and validation
  - Properties: `url` and `is_image`

- **MenuItem Model**: Flat navigation structure
  - Label, URL, order, active status
  - Opens in new tab option
  - No nested menus (MVP simplification)

**API Endpoints** (3 complete routers):
- `/api/v1/sections/` - PageSection CRUD + reorder
  - GET / - List with filtering (page, type, active)
  - POST / - Create with validation
  - GET /{id} - Get single
  - PUT /{id} - Update with validation
  - DELETE /{id} - Delete
  - PATCH /{id}/reorder - Change order only

- `/api/v1/assets/` - File upload + management
  - GET / - List with pagination and filtering
  - POST /upload - Multipart file upload
  - GET /{id} - Get asset with URL
  - DELETE /{id} - Delete with optional file removal

- `/api/v1/menu-items/` - Navigation CRUD + reorder
  - GET / - List with filtering
  - POST / - Create
  - GET /{id} - Get single
  - PUT /{id} - Update
  - DELETE /{id} - Delete
  - PATCH /{id}/reorder - Change order only

**Validation & Security**:
- Pydantic content validation (HeroSectionContent, ContentBlockContent, ProductGridContent)
- File type validation (images only: jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg)
- File size limits (10MB maximum)
- Max 50 products per product grid
- UUID filenames prevent overwrites
- Alt text support for accessibility

**Documentation**:
- `docs/CMS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- API documentation auto-generated in Swagger UI
- Test script: `test_cms_models.py`

### Changed
- Updated `main.py` to register 3 new API routers
- Modified startup scripts to use `py -3.10` instead of `python`
- Enhanced CORS to support LAN access (192.168.1.133)
- Frontend Vite config to bind to 0.0.0.0 for network access

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Changed Literal types to str in SQLModel tables
  - Issue: `TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class`
  - Cause: SQLModel doesn't support Literal types in database columns
  - Solution: Use str types, validate via Pydantic schemas and API
  - Commit: `4892f5a`

### Technical Details
- Architecture: Simplified MVP approach (5 days vs 4 weeks)
- Zero new npm dependencies
- Models: 262 lines (page_section.py, asset.py, menu_item.py)
- APIs: 457 lines (sections.py, assets.py, menu_items.py)
- Tests: test_cms_models.py (automated validation)
- Storage: backend/static/uploads/ (auto-dated structure)

### Roadmap (5-Day Plan)
- **Day 1 (Complete)**: Backend models + APIs
- **Day 2 (Next)**: Frontend admin components
- **Day 3**: Homepage integration
- **Day 4**: Polish & UX improvements
- **Day 5**: Testing & documentation

### Design Philosophy
> "Ship the boring, simple version first. The original plan was building a Ferrari when designers need a bicycle."
> â€” ecommerce-architect agent

**Key Principles**:
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - build for today, not tomorrow
- Validate before scaling - ship MVP, gather feedback
- No premature optimization - add complexity only when needed
- Zero new dependencies - use what we have
