# Quick Start Guide - Admin Panel

## Issue Fixed!

The white screen issue has been resolved. The problem was that the vite.config.js needed the package.json to specify `"type": "module"` for ESM imports.

## Troubleshooting

### White Screen?
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify both servers are running:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5174
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
3. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or F5)
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Can't Save Posts?
- Check backend is running
- Open browser console to see error messages
- Verify slug is unique (no duplicate slugs allowed)

### Design Changes Not Saving?
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify CORS is enabled (already done)
- Try creating a new design instead of updating
